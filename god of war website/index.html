            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
                Starting with the release of God of War in 2005 on PlayStation®2, Santa Monica Studio has
                created seven games across multiple platforms. Up to the most recent release in 2018, the 
                franchise focused on Kratos’ journey in the Greek world, following a path 
                of vengeance as a result of being tricked into killing his family by the Olympian gods.
                Now, living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, 
                unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair 
                will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.

        <p>Kratos (Greek: Κράτος) is the titular playable protagonist of the God of War series. Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier and a Spartan General, up until he lost his wife and daughter when he killed them, albeit by accident, under Ares' command, earning him the nickname of the "Ghost of Sparta", after which he renounced his service to the War God, eventually killing him and ascending to Godhood by becoming the new "God of War", before exacting revenge against his father, the Olympians and the Titans who betrayed him.
            After successfully exacting his vengeance, Kratos escaped into the world of Norse Gods by settling down in Midgard in Ancient Norway where he married another woman named Faye and bore a son named Atreus who together, after the boy's mother’s death, would embark on a journey to spread her ashes at the highest peak of all the nine realms.</p>

        <p>In contrast to the Greek pantheon, God of War (2018) set Kratos on a 
            new journey with the Norse world, leaving his old life behind and seeking a new life with his son Atreus. </p>
